# FINAL FIX SCRIPT - All Issues

## Issue Analysis

Based on the errors, the problems are:

1. **Profile Posts Not Showing**: Working query but not displaying 
2. **Comments Failing**: RLS or auth issue
3. **Likes Failing**: RLS or auth issue  
4. **Communities Fixed**: ✅ Removed privacy_level
5. **Share Button Missing**: Need to implement
6. **Profile Editing**: Need modal forms

## Root Cause

RLS policies are enforcing `auth.uid() = user_id/author_id` but some frontend calls may not have proper auth context.

## Fix Strategy

### 1. Add Debug Logging
Add console.log in all operations to see exactly what's failing

### 2. Simplify Auth Checks
Use more defensive programming in the helper functions

### 3. Fix Profile Posts
The posts exist in DB but aren't displaying - check the mapping

### 4. Add Share Button
Implement the share functionality in Home.jsx

### 5. Add Profile Editing
Create modal forms for editing profile sections

## Implementation Plan

1. **Fix Profile.jsx** - Add logging and fix data mapping
2. **Fix Comments/Likes** - Add error handling and auth checks  
3. **Add Share Button** - Simple share functionality
4. **Add Profile Editing** - Modal forms for each section

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Profile shows user's posts
- ✅ Comments work without errors
- ✅ Likes work without errors  
- ✅ Share button functional
- ✅ Profile sections editable
- ✅ All 400 errors resolved
