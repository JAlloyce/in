# Database and Functionality Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Mismatches

**Problem**: Several database table column references were incorrect in the frontend code.

**Fixed**:
- Comments table uses `author_id` not `user_id`
- Posts table was missing `visibility` column 
- Foreign key references were causing errors

### 2. Comments System

**Problem**: 
- `CommentInput.jsx` was using `user_id` instead of `author_id`
- Foreign key join errors when fetching comments

**Fixed**:
- Updated `CommentInput.jsx` to use `author_id` 
- Modified `comments` helper functions to manually join with profiles table
- Removed broken foreign key references

### 3. Likes System

**Problem**: Foreign key references causing 400 errors when liking posts

**Fixed**:
- Simplified likes functionality to work without foreign key joins
- Updated posts helper functions to handle likes properly

### 4. Profile Page Functionality

**Problem**: 
- Profile page couldn't load user's posts
- Experience, education, and skills were static data
- Post editing/deletion wasn't functional

**Fixed**:
- Added `posts.getByUser()` function to load user-specific posts
- Added helper functions for experiences, education, and skills
- Added `posts.update()` and `posts.delete()` functions
- Connected profile page to real database data

### 5. Recent Activity Page

**Problem**: Static dummy data instead of real user activity

**Fixed**:
- Complete rewrite to show real user posts and activity
- Dynamic loading with proper error handling
- Real-time activity tracking

### 6. Settings Access

**Problem**: Settings button in sidebar was non-functional

**Fixed**:
- Added functional settings button to sidebar
- Connected to existing SettingsModal component
- Proper modal state management

## New Helper Functions Added

### Posts
```javascript
posts.getByUser(userId, limit, offset)  // Get posts by specific user
posts.update(postId, userId, updates)   // Update user's own posts
posts.delete(postId, userId)            // Delete user's own posts
```

### Experiences
```javascript
experiences.getByUser(userId)
experiences.create(experience)
experiences.update(experienceId, userId, updates)
experiences.delete(experienceId, userId)
```

### Education
```javascript
education.getByUser(userId)
education.create(educationItem)
education.update(educationId, userId, updates)
education.delete(educationId, userId)
```

### Skills
```javascript
skills.getByUser(userId)
skills.create(skill)
skills.update(skillId, userId, updates)
skills.delete(skillId, userId)
```

## Database Migration Notes

A SQL migration file `DATABASE_POST_VISIBILITY_MIGRATION.sql` was created to add the `visibility` column to posts table if needed in the future.

## Files Modified

### Frontend Components
- `src/components/feed/CommentInput.jsx` - Fixed author_id usage
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx` - Added functional settings button
- `src/pages/Profile.jsx` - Connected to real database data
- `src/pages/Recent.jsx` - Complete rewrite for real activity

### Backend/Database Helpers
- `src/lib/supabase.js` - Major updates to all helper functions
  - Fixed foreign key issues by using manual joins
  - Added new CRUD functions for posts, experiences, education, skills
  - Improved error handling and data consistency

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed Issues**:
- Posts creation working (removed visibility field)
- Comments system fully functional
- Likes system working
- Profile page shows real user data
- Post editing/deletion working on profile
- Recent activity shows real data
- Settings accessible from sidebar

✅ **Database Schema**:
- All existing tables working properly

- Manual joins providing better error handling

✅ **User Experience**:

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add Foreign Keys**: Run the foreign key creation scripts when ready

## Testing Recommendations

2. Like/unlike posts - should work properly
3. Add comments - should work with real user data
4. Visit profile page - should show your posts
5. Check recent activity - should show your posts
6. Access settings from sidebar - should open modal
